#### By _**James R. Howard**_

## Description

_This application is using C# to allow a user to insert information(name, phone number, email, and address) to create a contact. the user also has the ability to delete all contacts at any point. from the home page the user will see a list of contacts if the have entered some; if not the home page will display "You dont currently have any contacts." there is also "add new contact" so that they can populate the address book. Once the user clicks on "add new contact" they are taken to a page with a form that has 4 entry fields(name, phone number, email, and address) *note that they are all required fields. When the user clicks the submit button they are taken to a page that shows them their new contact and has two prompts at the bottom "add a new contact" and "view all contacts". add a new contact will take them back to the submission forms, and view all will take them to the main page displaying a list of contact names. If the user clicks on the contacts names they will be taken to a page that shows the rest of that contacts information._
